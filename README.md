# GamePhysics_Collision_Response
## Game Physics project simulating collision and response using Circle Collision and AABB. The project has been developed using SDL and ImGui.

### Project 1 - Ball and Brick
#### The simulation demonstrates circle collision and AABB collision and response using an example of ball and brick. User can control the brick using mouse, hitting the ball with the brick will add some amount of velocity to ball's current velocity. Ball's velocity gradually dissipates as it hits the wall and bounces back

### Project 2 - Raining Bullets
#### The simulation demonstrates circle collision and AABB collision and response using an example of raining bullets. Bullets are generated at random location off screen and flow downwards. The player can control the planet using the mouse and can collide with bullets. Collision will trigger a sound effect as well.
